# Weekly Report Plugin for ColdFront

This plugin adds a weekly report feature to ColdFront's UI and is also used as an example plugin in ColdFront's [plugin docs](https://coldfront.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin/how_to_create_a_plugin/).

The app's page illustrates all of an admin's allocations, resource types, user logins, and allocations that expire soon or that were just created.
